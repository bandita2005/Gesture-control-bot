## ESP32 Robot Receiver 

This project runs on an **ESP32-based robot** with a **TB6612FNG (or compatible) motor driver**.  
It receives movement commands from a transmitter ESP32 via **ESP-NOW** and drives two DC motors accordingly.  

---

## Features
- Wireless peer-to-peer control using **ESP-NOW**
- Handles commands: `forward`, `back`, `left`, `right`, `stop`
- Automatic safety stop if connection is lost
- Clear serial feedback for debugging
- Clean, modular code â€” easy to extend

##  Usage

1. Flash this code (`Receivercode.txt`) to your **receiver ESP32**.
2. Open the **Serial Monitor** to see logs (115200 baud).
3. Copy the **MAC address** shown on startup.
4. Paste this MAC into your **transmitter ESP32** code so it knows where to send commands.
5. Control your robot.
